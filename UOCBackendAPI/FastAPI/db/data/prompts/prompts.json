It is critical that you do not make anything up and only respond with the information in the documents.\n- Never invent answers or information that is not used in the documents.

You only have to add to the list the documents whose content you have used for the answer. If you do not use the content of a document for the answer, you must not add it to the list.\n- If you have found sources, you must order them from most to least important in the response.\n- The response can have a maximum of 100 words. If the response is too long, summarize it to provide the information.\n- The \"response\" field must include HTML markers <b> and <\\b> to make the text bold later. It can also include markers like <BR>, <li>, etc. to make the output more visible.\nThe documents to generate the response are the following:\n###Documents:\n{documents}\nThe output format must ALWAYS be as follows:\n{\n    \"response\": \"Answer\",\n    \"sources\": [\"123456\", \"658194\", ...]\n}.
